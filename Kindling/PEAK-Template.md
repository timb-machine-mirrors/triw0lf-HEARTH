## PREPARE: Define the Hunt

| **Hunt Information**            | **Details** |
|----------------------------------|-------------|
| **Hypothesis**                  | [What are you hunting for and why?] |
| **Threat Hunter Name**          | [Name of the threat hunter] |
| **Date**                        | [Date of hunt] |
| **Requestor**                   | [Person or team requesting the hunt] |
| **Timeframe for hunt**          | [Expected duration for the hunt] |

## Scoping with the ABLE Methodology

Clearly define your hunt scope using the ABLE framework. Replace all placeholders (`[ ]`) with relevant details for your scenario.

| **Field**   | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | **Your Input**                   |
|-------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Actor**   | *(Optional)* Identify the threat actor involved with the behavior, if applicable. This step is optional because hunts aren’t always tied to a specific actor. You may be investigating techniques used across multiple adversaries or looking for suspicious activity regardless of attribution. Focus on the what and how before the who, unless actor context adds meaningful value to the hunt.  | `[Threat Actor or N/A]`          |
| **Behavior**| Describe the actions observed or expected, including tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Clearly specify methods or tools involved.                                                                                                                                                 | `[Describe observed or expected behavior]` |
| **Location**| Specify where the activity occurred, such as an endpoint, network segment, or cloud environment.                                                                                                                                 | `[Location]`            |
| **Evidence**| Clearly list logs, artifacts, or telemetry supporting your hypothesis. For each source, provide critical fields required to validate the behavior, and include specific examples of observed or known malicious activity to illustrate expected findings. | `- Source: [Log Source]`<br>`- Key Fields: [Critical Fields]`<br>`- Example: [Expected Example of Malicious Activity]`<br><br>`- Source: [Additional Source]`<br>`- Key Fields: [Critical Fields]`<br>`- Example: [Expected Example of Malicious Activity]` |

## EXECUTE: Run the Hunt

### Hunting Queries
*(Document queries for Splunk, Sigma, KQL, or another query language to execute the hunt. Capture any adjustments made during analysis and iterate on findings.)*

#### Initial Query
`index=main sourcetype=linux:audit "sudo" OR "pkexec"  
| stats count by user, command, parent_process `

- **Notes:**  
  - Did this query return expected results?  
  - Were there false positives or gaps?  
  - How did you refine the query based on findings?  

#### Refined Query (if applicable)
`index=main sourcetype=linux:audit "sudo" OR "pkexec"  
| stats count by user, command, parent_process, _time  
| sort - _time `

- **Rationale for Refinement:**  
  - Added `_time` for better event sequencing.  
  - Applied `sort` to identify patterns in privilege escalation attempts.  

### Visualization or Analytics
*(Describe any dashboards, anomaly detection methods, or visualizations used. Capture observations and note whether visualizations revealed additional insights. **Add screenshots!**)*  

- **Examples:**  
  - Time-series charts to detect activity spikes  
  - Heatmaps of unusual application installs  

### Detection Logic
*(How would this be turned into a detection rule? Thresholds, tuning considerations, etc.)*  

- **Initial Detection Criteria:**  
  - What conditions would trigger an alert?  
  - Are there threshold values that indicate malicious activity?  

- **Refinements After Review:**  
  - Did certain legitimate activities cause false positives?  
  - How can you tune the rule to focus on real threats?  

### Capturing Your Analysis & Iteration
- **Summarize insights gained from each query modification and visualization.**  
- **Reiterate key findings:**  
  - Did this query lead to any findings, false positives, or hypotheses for further hunting?  
  - If this hunt were repeated, what changes should be made?  
  - Does this hunt generate ideas for additional hunts?  

- **Document the next steps for refining queries for detections and other outputs.**
